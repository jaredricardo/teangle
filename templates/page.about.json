Back when Teangle was just an idea ! I remember we‚Äôd spend hours brainstorming names, slogans, working on the logo‚Ä¶ daydreaming about our vision for Teangle !¬†¬†<br\/><br\/>For the first time in a long time, Philippe was excited and passionate about something. This filled my heart with so much joy. & I wanted to help in any way I could.<br\/><br\/>At the time, I was a marine biologist living it up in the land of down under (Australia) with a bucket full of plans : next up New Zealand, working with sharks in the Bahamas... I had it all laid out (well sort of) with NO intention of returning home anytime soon.¬†<br\/><br\/>That‚Äôs the thing about life isn‚Äôt it, plans OFTEN change...<br\/><br\/>So through a series of events, I found myself standing outside my mom's door with my suitcase : ‚ÄòSURPRISE‚Äô I screamed ! Little did I know, I was the one who was about to embark on an adventure full of surprises.¬†<\/p><p><\/p><p>Amongst other things, moving back home meant spending more time with Philippe AND getting more intimate with Teangle.¬†In my free time, I'd help out wherever I could ; anything from copywriting, to packing orders, managing Teangles social media accounts...<br\/><br\/>One day it dawned on me that every day I was excited to get home to write blogs about Matcha, chat with the Teangle family, envision the design of the website...¬†<br\/>I realized that day that I knew what I wanted. I wanted to help people fall in love with a ritual that would change their lives!<br\/><br\/>Ever since I was a little girl, I've always said that my mission in life is to be a sun for everyone around me, to spread my light and brighten their day ! Teangle is my vehicle to do exactly that, it enables me to spread positive vibes on a MASSIVE scale and not just to people around me - because friends, we‚Äôre going worldwide !¬†<br\/><br\/>Philippe often says that Teangle is the embodiment of ME - a positive cheerleader spreading good vibes. And it really is an extension of myself.<br\/><br\/>Today, I work alongside my brother running Teangle, I'm his trusty sidekick, his right hand and above all else his sister !¬†<br\/><br\/>Together, we‚Äôre building THE biggest and best family in the world - the Teangle family, a group of like minded individuals with a thirst for life who are all about using their energy to spread the feeling of joie de vivre in all those around them.<\/p><p><\/p><p>& all of this, one cup of Matcha at a time.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style":"primary","align_text":"left","layout":"right","divider":false}},"featured-collection":{"type":"featured-collection","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Shop Signature Blends","home_featured_products":"matcha","per_row":3,"rows":1,"mobile_scrollable":true,"view_all":false,"divider":false}}},"order":["main","16430198073cec8737","16420775119b5e0e0d","9056c5c0-d3c4-4343-9196-82e7436ce221","bac028dd-97c7-4360-a8dd-5e782b87153e","5f2ca668-a087-4ec2-af04-df3113b0bfd6","1642077638c9eefa22","featured-collection"]}
