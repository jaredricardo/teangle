The minerals in our tea are so rich that they will give you a boost of energy, they may aid your weight loss, may lower your risk of cancer, and provide you with anti-aging benefits. And the best part about it? Our powder is so concentrated, it only takes two servings a day to get the full benefit. This is much more than what other brands can claim, because sometimes you have to put on cup after cup to get the same results. Awesome, isn't it? Forget about wet tea bags and bulky infusers. Just add Teangle Matcha to hot or cold water and shake vigorously. Quick and easy, it only takes a minute when you only have five.<\/p>"}},"faq-2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Is Teangle healthier than standard green tea?","text":"<p>Yes!<\/p><p>The health benefits of matcha tea far exceed those of green tea.<\/p><p>Although both types of tea come from the same plant \"camellia sinensis\", a major difference lies in the fact that when we drink green tea, the leaves get infused into hot water and are then discarded.
